            <h2>Welcome to My Webpage! </h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name's Eli. I recently graduated the University of Mary Washington with a degree in <br>
                Communication and Digital Studies. I have experience in several skill groups, <br>
                such as communications, Chinese as well as coding and web development languages like Python, <br>
                SQL, HTML and CSS. As things stand, I am pursuing a job where I can employ these skills <br>
                equally. I would especially enjoy work where I can substantially utilize my creative flair <br>
                and passion for more artistically-oriented or abstract projects, though I would also like to <br>
                ensure I have space to express the depth of my Chinese fluency, having studied the <br>
                language in both the States and Taiwan for a combined total of 11 years. <br>
                More generally, I enjoy work where I can not only use my affinity for creative freedom, <br>
                but put it towards helping people. Giving back to people and helping those in need is as equal a part <br>
                of my worldview as my artistic ambition. While right now, I am still figuring out what these elements <br>
                will ultimately synthesize into, in the distant future, I hope I can realize each of the stories I <br>
                currently have in the works. Though I would primarily like to design my game, as gaming is a foremost hobby of mine, <br>
                I would also like to animate and collaborate with animators to bring my animated tv show to life and <br>
                a film crew to materialize my film project. In the meantime, I will continue to hone my software <br>
                engineering skills and contribute to my ever-expanding portfolio with fine-tuned robust coding projects. <br>
